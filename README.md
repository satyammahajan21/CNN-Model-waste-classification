Dataset for the project is linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data

This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into different categories.  This is a crucial step in effective recycling and waste management, enabling automated sorting and processing of plastic waste.

## Project Overview

Plastic waste poses a significant environmental challenge.  Accurate and efficient identification of different plastic types is essential for proper recycling. This project leverages the power of deep learning, specifically CNNs, to automate this process.  The model is trained on a dataset of plastic waste images and can classify them into predefined categories (e.g., PET, HDPE, PVC, etc.).
